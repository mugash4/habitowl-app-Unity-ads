## ❓ FAQ for Non-Developers

### Q: What is expo-ads-admob?
**A**: It's an OLD, DEPRECATED package that doesn't work anymore.

### Q: What should I use instead?
**A**: `react-native-google-mobile-ads` (which you already have in package.json)

### Q: Why did my build fail before?
**A**: The AdService was too complex. I simplified it to work reliably.

### Q: Will ads show in `npm start`?

- EAS builds (production)
- Physical devices (not simulator)
- NOT in Expo Go app
- NOT in web version

### Q: How do I test ads?
**A**: 
1. Run: `eas build -p android --profile preview`
2. Download the APK
3. Install on your Android phone
4. Open app → You'll see ads!

### Q: Do I need to change anything in my code?
**A**: NO! I already fixed everything. Just:

**A**: Same process:
```bash
eas build -p ios --profile production

Your `app.json` is perfect! No changes needed. ✅

## 💡 Key Points to Remember

### ✅ DO:
- Use `eas build` to test ads
- Test on physical Android device
- Wait 24-48 hours for AdMob approval

### ❌ DON'T:
- Try to use expo-ads-admob (it's dead)
- Expect ads in Expo Go
- Expect ads in `npm start`
- Expect ads on web version

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Error: "eas command not found"
**Fix**:
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
```

### Error: "Build failed"
**Check**:
1. Run `npm install` first
2. Make sure internet connection stable
3. Check EAS build logs

### Ads not showing:
**Remember**:
