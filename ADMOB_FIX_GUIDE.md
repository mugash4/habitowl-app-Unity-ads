# 🔧 AdMob Fix Guide - HabitOwl

## 🎯 Problem Summary

You were experiencing build issues with `react-native-google-mobile-ads`. This is actually the **CORRECT** package to use (not expo-ads-admob which is deprecated).

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. **Simplified AdService.js**
**Problem**: Complex implementation causing build failures  
**Solution**: Simplified service with proper error handling

**Key Changes**:
- ✅ Added safe module loading (won't crash if module unavailable)
- ✅ Platform checks (web vs native)
- ✅ Development mode support (test ads)
- ✅ Graceful fallback when ads unavailable
- ✅ Better error messages

### 2. **Created BannerAd.js Component**
**Problem**: No reusable banner component  
**Solution**: Clean, simple component for banner ads

**Features**:
- ✅ Automatically hides on web
- ✅ Respects premium status
- ✅ Safe module loading
- ✅ Easy to use in any screen

### 3. **Verified app.json Configuration**
Your configuration is **CORRECT**! ✅

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "react-native-google-mobile-ads",
      {
        "androidAppId": "ca-app-pub-2371616866592450~9516891462",
        "iosAppId": "ca-app-pub-2371616866592450~9516891462"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

## 📱 Important: Understanding AdMob with Expo

### Why expo-ads-admob Won't Work:
- ❌ **Deprecated** since Expo SDK 46
- ❌ **Removed** from Expo completely
- ❌ **Not compatible** with EAS Build
- ❌ **No longer maintained**

### Why react-native-google-mobile-ads IS Correct:
- ✅ **Official Google solution**
- ✅ **Works with Expo SDK 51**
- ✅ **Compatible with EAS Build**
- ✅ **Actively maintained**
- ✅ **Full feature support**

---

## 🚀 How to Use the Fixed Version

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Testing Locally

**Important**: AdMob only works in **production builds** or **custom dev clients**.

**Won't work in**:
- ❌ Expo Go app
- ❌ `npm start` without custom dev client
- ❌ Web version

**Will work in**:
- ✅ EAS Build (production)
- ✅ Custom development build
- ✅ Deployed APK/AAB

### Step 3: Build for Testing

**For Android APK (Testing)**:
```bash
eas build -p android --profile preview
```

**For Production (Play Store)**:
```bash
eas build -p android --profile production
```

### Step 4: Using Banner Ads in Your Screens

**Import the component**:
```javascript
import BannerAd from '../components/BannerAd';
```

**Add to your screen**:
```javascript
export default function YourScreen() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {/* Your content */}
      
      {/* Banner ad at bottom */}
      <BannerAd />
    </View>
  );
}
```

**That's it!** The component handles everything:
- Checks if user is premium
- Only shows on native platforms
- Handles loading/errors gracefully

## 🔍 Testing Your Ads

### Development Mode (Test Ads):
When running in `__DEV__` mode, the app automatically uses **Google test ad units**. These are safe to use and won't affect your AdMob account.

### Production Mode (Real Ads):
When you build with EAS (`eas build`), your actual ad unit IDs are used:
- Banner: `ca-app-pub-2371616866592450/1677929899`
- Interstitial: `ca-app-pub-2371616866592450/8051766556`
- Rewarded: `ca-app-pub-2371616866592450/9388898951`

### Testing Checklist:
1. Build APK: `eas build -p android --profile preview`
2. Download and install APK on your phone
3. Open the app
4. You should see test ads (if in dev mode)
5. Create habit, complete actions → Should show interstitial ads

---

## 🎮 Ad Implementation in Your App

### Current Ad Placements:

**1. Banner Ads (Passive)**:
- Shown at bottom of screens

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Module not found: react-native-google-mobile-ads"
**Cause**: Running in Expo Go or web  
**Solution**: This is normal! Ads only work in:
- EAS builds
- Custom dev clients
- NOT in Expo Go

**What happens**: App continues working, just no ads shown

### Issue 2: "Ads not showing in development"
**Cause**: Need to build with EAS  
**Solution**:
```bash
# Build development client
eas build -p android --profile development

# Or use preview build
eas build -p android --profile preview
```

### Issue 3: "Build fails with react-native-google-mobile-ads"
**Cause**: Missing configuration  
**Solution**: Make sure your `app.json` has:
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "react-native-google-mobile-ads",
      {
        "androidAppId": "YOUR-APP-ID",
        "iosAppId": "YOUR-APP-ID"
      }
    ],
    [
      "expo-build-properties",
      {
        "android": {
          "minSdkVersion": 23
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

Your config already has this! ✅

### Issue 4: "Ads showing but no revenue"
**Causes**:
- Using test ad IDs (in development)
- AdMob account not approved yet
- Ads policy violations

**Solutions**:
- Wait for AdMob approval (can take 24-48 hours)
- Make sure using real ad IDs in production
- Check AdMob dashboard for policy issues

---

## 📊 Verifying Your Setup

### Check 1: Package.json
```bash
cat package.json | grep "react-native-google-mobile-ads"
```
Should show: `"react-native-google-mobile-ads": "^14.2.3"` ✅

### Check 2: app.json Plugin
```bash
cat app.json | grep -A 5 "react-native-google-mobile-ads"
```
Should show your AdMob app ID ✅

### Check 3: AdService Working
Open your app and check console:
```
AdService initialized successfully ✅
Banner ad loaded ✅
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Development:
1. ✅ Fixed files are in place
2. ✅ Run `npm install`
3. ✅ Build with EAS: `eas build -p android --profile preview`
4. ✅ Test on physical device

### For Production:
1. ✅ AdMob app approved (check dashboard)
2. ✅ Real ad IDs configured (already done)
3. ✅ Build production: `eas build -p android --profile production`
4. ✅ Upload to Play Store

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Testing Without EAS Build Every Time:
**Create a custom development client**:
```bash
eas build -p android --profile development
```
Install this once, then use:
```bash
npm start --dev-client
```

### 2. Monitoring Ad Performance:
Check `AdService.getAdImpressionStats()` for:
- Total impressions
- Ads by type
- Recent ad activity

### 3. Balancing Ads & User Experience:
Current settings are optimized:
- 30-second cooldown (not too frequent)
- 5 ads per session max (not annoying)
- Strategic placement (after actions)

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before publishing:
- [ ] Build succeeds with `eas build`
- [ ] Ads show in preview build
- [ ] Premium users see no ads
- [ ] AdMob dashboard shows impressions
- [ ] No crashes when ads fail to load
- [ ] Web version works (no ads, no crashes)

---

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

### Check These Files:
1. `src/services/AdService.js` - Fixed version
2. `src/components/BannerAd.js` - New component
3. `app.json` - Plugin configuration
4. `package.json` - Dependencies

### Common Errors:

**Error**: "Invariant Violation: Native module cannot be null"
**Fix**: You're running in Expo Go. Use EAS build instead.

**Error**: "Ad request successful, but no ad returned"
**Fix**: Normal in development. AdMob returns test ads but may not always have inventory.

**Error**: "AdMob app ID is invalid"
**Fix**: Check your `app.json` has correct AdMob app ID (not ad unit ID)
