## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### "What is npm install?"
It's a command that downloads and installs all the tools your app needs to work. Think of it like downloading all the apps on your phone.

### "What is a terminal?"
It's a window where you type commands to tell the computer what to do. In VS Code, it's at the bottom.

### "Do I need to code?"
No! The app is already built. You just need to:
1. Install it (`npm install`)
2. Run it (`npm start`)
3. Customize settings (Firebase, AdMob)

### "What is Firebase?"
It's like a database in the cloud that stores your app's data (users, habits, etc.). It's free for small apps!

### "What is AdMob?"
It's Google's service for showing ads in apps. This is how free users generate revenue for you.

### "How do I change colors/text?"
1. Open the `src/` folder
2. Find the screen or component you want to edit
3. Look for text in quotes `"..."` or color codes like `#4f46e5`
4. Change them and save - the app will update automatically!
