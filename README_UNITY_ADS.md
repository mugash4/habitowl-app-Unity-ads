IOS_GAME_ID: 'YOUR_IOS_GAME_ID',          // Get from Unity Dashboard

ANDROID_BANNER: 'YOUR_ANDROID_BANNER_ID',
ANDROID_INTERSTITIAL: 'YOUR_ANDROID_INTERSTITIAL_ID',
ANDROID_REWARDED: 'YOUR_ANDROID_REWARDED_ID',

IOS_BANNER: 'YOUR_IOS_BANNER_ID',
IOS_INTERSTITIAL: 'YOUR_IOS_INTERSTITIAL_ID',
IOS_REWARDED: 'YOUR_IOS_REWARDED_ID',
```

**Don't have these IDs yet?**
‚Üí See `UNITY_ADS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for how to get them

### Step 2: Update Firebase Configuration (if needed)

- Automatically load and refresh

### Interstitial Ads
- Full-screen ads between actions

  - Completing habits
  - Creating new habits
  - Navigating to certain screens
- Respectful timing (30 second cooldown)
- Limited to 5 per session

### Rewarded Ads (Optional Feature)

## üí∞ Revenue Expectations

With Unity Ads, you can expect:

- **Banner Ads:** $0.50 - $2.00 per 1,000 impressions
- **Interstitial Ads:** $2.00 - $5.00 per 1,000 impressions
- **Rewarded Ads:** $5.00 - $15.00 per 1,000 impressions

**Example Revenue (150 active users):**
- 150 users √ó 10 sessions/day = 1,500 sessions
- ~5,000 banner impressions/day = $2.50 - $10/day
- ~300 interstitial impressions/day = $0.60 - $1.50/day
- **Total: $90 - $350/month** from ads alone

Plus Premium subscriptions: $4.99 √ó 20 users = $100/month

**Potential Total: $190 - $450/month**
